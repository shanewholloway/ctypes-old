comtypes
--------

**comtypes** is a pure Python COM package based on the ctypes ffi
foreign function library.

While the pywin32 package contains superior client side support for
dispatch based COM interfaces, it is not so good to access custom COM
interfaces.

**comtypes**, however, makes it easy to access and implement custom
and dual COM interfaces.

Documentation is sparse, there are two documents which are still work in progress:

`comtypes.client.html`_ describes the high level client side support, and 
`com_interfaces.html`_ describes how COM interfaces are defined.

.. _`com_interfaces.html`: com_interfaces.html

.. _`comtypes.client.html`: comtypes.client.html
