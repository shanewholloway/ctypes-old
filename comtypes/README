Bugs
====

Windows:

    test_comserver.py, TestLocalServer.test_get_typeinfo() fails with
    an access violation.  No idea why.

    There are memory leaks, run the tests with -umemleaks to see them.

Windows CE:

    6 tests still fail. One because the CoGetObject function is not
    found (it seems not to exist), the others because
    SafeArrayCreateVectorEx does not exist on CE.
