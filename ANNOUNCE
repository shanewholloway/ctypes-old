ctypes 0.6.3 released
=====================

Overview

    'ctypes' is a Python package to create and manipulate C data types
    in Python, and to call functions in dynamic link libraries/shared
    dlls. It allows wrapping these libraries in pure Python.

    It works on Windows, Linux and MacOS X (the latter require that
    your machine is supported by libffi).


Changes

    A critical bug with pointer instances was fixed, this makes the
    'incomplete types' sample code in the tutorial actually work.

    All ctypes objects are now correctly garbarge collected.  This
    *may* lead to crashes in your program (especially with callback
    functions, or pointers handed out to longer running C code).  You
    must keep a reference in Python to any object as long as it is
    used in foreign C code.

    All known bugs have been fixed.

    Again, a lot of changes to the COM package, but all this is still work in
    progress and unstable, and it has to be properly documented.


Enjoy,
