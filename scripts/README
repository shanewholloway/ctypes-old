This directory is for helper scripts

fetch_libffi:  shell script used to extract libffi from a gcc cvs
               checkout. Does some adaptations.

cvs-switch:    shell script which exchanges the CVS directories for
               the gcc repository with those for ctypes. Call again
	       to get to the old state.
	       Working with 2 repositories is not perfect, but
	       at least the information is available.
