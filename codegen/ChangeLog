	* The subprocess module is now required, although the code is
	still compatible with Python 2.3.

	* The '#define' symbols that cause compilation errors are now
	determined at runtime:

	If the '-c' option is given, compiler error messages are parsed to
	find those '#define ' symbols that are causing them.  These
	symbols are then appended to the file
	~/.ctypes_codegen/cparser_excludes.  If these errors occur, it is
	required to restart h2xml.py, but chances are good that the next
	run works better (it may be required to repeat this process
	several times until all errors have vanished).

	The cparser_config.py module has been removed because it does no
	longer list symbols that have to be excluded.

	* Fixed a problem in gccxmlparser.py when 'Constructor'
	descriptions created by gccxml gave no 'name' attribute.

	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py: Added a USE_COMMENTS variable
	which allows to turn comment generation off.  Generated
	'_anonymous_' declarations for unnamed structure fields.

	Changed the way libraries are loaded, the cdecl and stdcall
	decorators are no longer used.  Functions are generated with
	assignments of .restype and .argtypes.:

	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py: When generating the '__all__'
	list, don't break long strings.

	* h2xml does no longer create a file named 'None' when no output
	file was given on the command line.

	* Added a TODO list.

	* Initial import of the current ctypes codegenerator version.
