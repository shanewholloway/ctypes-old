Migration to libffi
===================

To make the windows and non-windows version of ctypes more compatible,
libffi will also be used on windows.  In CVS is a hacked version of
libffi, checked out from the GCC CVS repository trunk some days ago,
configured on linux, and then further hacked on windows.

    First step of the libffi migration completed, the state will be
    tagged as 'libffi_integration_1'.

    The unittests run all, except that one cannot pass structures by
    value to function calls.

    The benchmark shows that function calls are slightly slower now:
        func("abc", 3)   1.51 us - 1.24 us
	func()           1.56 us - 1.32 us
