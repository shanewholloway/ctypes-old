	* Inmplemented this change in a different way again.

	* Reverted this change because it does not (yet) work:

	* ctypeslib/codegen/cparser.py: The final xml-file is now created
	before searching for preprocessor definitions (if no output file
	is requested it will be deleted afterwards).  The advantage is
	that compilation errors are detected early and don't disturb the
	cpp magic.

2006-11-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* ctypeslib\dynamic_module.y: Generate the .h, .xml, and
	.typedesc.bz2 files in a temporary directory.  Should that
	directory contain the GCCXML version number? Or the ctypeslib
	version number?

2006-11-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* ctypeslib\codegen\gccxmlparser.py: Patch from Giovanni Bajo: Use
	cElementtree, if installed, instead of xml.sax for XML parsing.
	This gives a significant speedup.

2006-11-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* ctypeslib\experimental\*.py contains experimental stuff.  This
	directory is *not* package because it doesn't contain an
	__init__.py file.
	
	* ctypeslib\dynamic_module.py: A module implementing incremental,
	dynamic code generation. Removed the former ctypeslib\dynmod.py.

	* Renamed restructured the ctypes_codegen package.  It is now
	named ctypeslib, with a subpackage ctypeslib.codegen.  The
	ctypeslib package now contains the h2xml and xml2py scripts.

2006-10-31  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py (Generator.init_value): Reworked
	the init function to use eval, the output should be correct now.

	* Cast #define'd symbols to the type found, to avoid compilation
	errors because of 'const'ness mismatch.

2006-10-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Added ctypes_codegen.test package for codegenerator tests.
	
	* Renamed modules from ctypes_codegen.h2xml_main to
	ctypes_codegen.h2xml and ctypes_codegen.xml2py to
	ctypes_codegen.xml2py.

	So, with Python2.5 it is possible to execute
	'python -m ctypes_codegen.h2xml ...' and
	'python -m ctypes_codegen.xml2py ...'.

	* Added '#!/usr/bin/env python' to the h2xml.py and xml2py.py
	scripts.  Patch by Victor Stinner.

2006-09-19  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* cparser.py: Lots of changes.  The summary: xml2py doesn't use a
	config file for #define symbols to exclude, instead it loops
	several times to find the symbols that don't compile.
	
	* scripts/xml2py_main.py: Change the generated code that loads
	libraries.  On windows, the absolute pathname is no longer used.

	* codegenerator.py: Rework the .init_value() method so that
	decode_value() is used in all cases.  Correct the decoding of
	integer values - it seems decimal numbers are used except when
	they start with a '0' which means hex (previously I assumed hex
	always).

2006-09-15  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* codegenerator.py: Refactored a method 'generate_items' out of
	'generate_code'.  This allows better incremental code generation.

	* os.name is 'win32', not 'nt', on windows. This prevented that
	definitions from ctypes.wintypes to be used in generated code.

2006-09-06  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* codegenerator.py: '_anonymous_' declarations are only generated
	for unnamed Structure/Union fields if the type of the field is a
	Structure or Union.  (Windows header files contain unnamed
	structure fields of type 'int', probably for padding.)

2006-08-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* codegenerator.py: Empty _field_ attributes are now generated for
	Structure/Union (for weird reasons having to do with COM
	interfaces NO _fields_ attribute was generated before).

2006-06-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* xml2py.py: Remove the use_generators argument and the
	corresponding command line option for xml2py.py, since the code
	generator does not create decorators any more.

	Add a '-c' command line option which will insert comments in the
	generated code that will point the the location in the include
	file where the data types are defined.  This replaces the
	hardcoded USE_COMMENTS variable.

2006-06-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* xml2py.py: The '-l' option for the xml2py.py script now takes
	the linker library name instead of the library pathname.  I still
	have to find out which library (on posix systems) really defines a
	function.  The generated code that loads the libraries has been
	reworked.

2006-06-14  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* h2xml.py: The subprocess module is now required, although the
	code is still compatible with Python 2.3.

	* The '#define' symbols that cause compilation errors are now
	determined at runtime:

	If the '-c' option is given, compiler error messages are parsed to
	find those '#define ' symbols that are causing them.  These
	symbols are then appended to the file
	~/.ctypes_codegen/cparser_excludes.  If these errors occur, it is
	required to restart h2xml.py, but chances are good that the next
	run works better (it may be required to repeat this process
	several times until all errors have vanished).

	The cparser_config.py module has been removed because it does no
	longer list symbols that have to be excluded.

2006-06-13  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Fixed a problem in gccxmlparser.py when 'Constructor'
	descriptions created by gccxml gave no 'name' attribute.

2006-06-09  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py: Added a USE_COMMENTS variable
	which allows to turn comment generation off.  Generated
	'_anonymous_' declarations for unnamed structure fields.

	Changed the way libraries are loaded, the cdecl and stdcall
	decorators are no longer used.  Functions are generated with
	assignments of .restype and .argtypes.:

2006-06-08  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py: When generating the '__all__'
	list, don't break long strings.

	* h2xml does no longer create a file named 'None' when no output
	file was given on the command line.

	* Added a TODO list.

	* Initial import of the current ctypes codegenerator version.
