	* com/server.py: In UseCommandLine, print a short explanation that
	the regserver or unregserver flag is required.  Don't mention the
	/automation flag, it is only used by windows (that's my
	impression, at least).

	* com/automation.py: VARIANT does now handle the COM DATE type
	VT_DATE as Python datetime.

	* com/automation.py: Integers in a VARIANT use the VT_I4 typecode
	instead of VT_INT. Python longs are converted to ints if possible,
 	if not they are stored as VT_R8.

	* com/hresult.py, samples: Make all 8-digit hex constants long, to
	avoid future warnings in Python 2.3

	* ctypes.com: Improve the automatic COM reference counting.
	AddRef() is now automatically called when callback functions (COM
	methods implemented in Python) receive a COM interface pointer as
	parameter.  This matches the __del__ method which calls Release().

2004-07-16  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* samples\server\IExplorer\toolband.py: New sample implementing an
	Internet Explorer Toolband control.

	* ctypes.com.errorinfo:  New interfaces.

	* ctypes.com: New function CreateGuid()

	More useful debug info from IUnknown.QueryInterface and
	ClassFactory.CreateInstance calls.

	New interface_name(iid) function, which returns a COM interface
	name from it's iid.
