ctypes reference
================

ctypes functions
----------------

``addressof(obj)`` : funcdesc
    Returns the address of the memory buffer as integer.  ``obj`` must
    be an instance of a ctypes type.

``alignment(obj_or_type)`` : funcdesc
    Returns the alignment requirements of a ctypes type.
    ``obj_or_type`` must be a ctypes type or instance.

``ArgumentError()`` : excdesc
    This exception is raised when a foreign function call cannot
    convert one of the passed arguments.

``byref(obj)`` : funcdesc
    Returns a light-weight pointer to ``obj``, which must be an
    instance of a ctypes type. The returned object can only be used as
    a foreign function call parameter. It behaves similar to
    ``pointer(obj)``, but the construction is a lot faster.

``cast(obj, type)`` : funcdesc
    This function is similar to the cast operator in C. It returns a
    new instance of ``type`` which points to the same memory block as
    ``obj``. ``type`` must be a pointer type, and ``obj`` must be an
    object that can be interpreted as a pointer.

``CFUNCTYPE(restype, *argtypes)`` : funcdesc
    This is a factory function that returns a function prototype. The
    function prototype describes a function that has a result type of
    ``restype``, and accepts arguments as specified by
    ``argtypes``. The function prototype can be used to construct
    several kinds of functions, depending on how the prototype is
    called.

    The prototypes returned by ``CFUNCTYPE`` or ``PYFUNCTYPE`` create
    functions that use the standard C calling convention, prototypes
    returned from ``WINFUNCTYPE`` (on Windows) use the ``__stdcall``
    calling convention.

    Functions created by calling the ``CFUNCTYPE`` and ``WINFUNCTYPE``
    prototypes release the Python GIL before entering the foreign
    function, and acquire it back after leaving the function code.

``create_string_buffer(init_or_size[, size])`` : funcdesc
    This function creates a mutable character buffer. The returned
    object is a ctypes array of ``c_char``.

    ``init_or_size`` must be an integer which specifies the size of
    the array, or a string which will be used to initialize the array
    items.

    If a string is specified as first argument, the buffer is made one
    item larger than the length of the string so that the last element
    in the array is a NUL termination character. An integer can be
    passed as second argument which allows to specify the size of the
    array if the length of the string should not be used.

    If the first parameter is a unicode string, it is converted into
    an 8-bit string according to ctypes conversion rules.

``create_unicode_buffer(init_or_size[, size])`` : funcdesc
    This function creates a mutable unicode character buffer. The
    returned object is a ctypes array of ``c_wchar``.

    ``init_or_size`` must be an integer which specifies the size of
    the array, or a unicode string which will be used to initialize
    the array items.

    If a unicode string is specified as first argument, the buffer is
    made one item larger than the length of the string so that the
    last element in the array is a NUL termination character. An
    integer can be passed as second argument which allows to specify
    the size of the array if the length of the string should not be
    used.

    If the first parameter is a 8-bit string, it is converted into an
    unicode string according to ctypes conversion rules.

``DllCanUnloadNow()`` : funcdesc
    Windows only: This function is a hook which allows to implement
    inprocess COM servers with ctypes. It is called from the
    DllCanUnloadNow function that the _ctypes extension dll exports.

``DllGetClassObject()`` : funcdesc
    Windows only: This function is a hook which allows to implement
    inprocess COM servers with ctypes. It is called from the
    DllGetClassObject function that the ``_ctypes`` extension dll exports.

``FormatError([code])`` : funcdesc
    Windows only: Returns a textual description of the error code. If
    no error code is specified, the last error code is used by calling
    the Windows api function GetLastError.

``GetLastError()`` : funcdesc
    Windows only: Returns the last error code set by Windows in the
    calling thread.

``memmove(dst, src, count)`` : funcdesc
    Same as the standard C memmove library function: copies ``count``
    bytes from ``src`` to ``dst``. ``dst`` and ``src`` must be
    integers or ctypes instances that can be converted to pointers.

``memset(dst, c, count)`` : funcdesc
    Same as the standard C memset library function: fills the memory
    block at address ``dst`` with ``count`` bytes of value
    ``c``. ``dst`` must be an integer specifying an address, or a
    ctypes instance.

``POINTER(type)`` : funcdesc
    This factory function creates and returns a new ctypes pointer
    type. Pointer types are cached an reused internally, so calling
    this function repeatedly is cheap. type must be a ctypes type.

``pointer(obj)`` : funcdesc
    This function creates a new pointer instance, pointing to
    ``obj``. The returned object is of the type POINTER(type(obj)).

    Note: If you just want to pass a pointer to an object to a foreign
    function call, you should use ``byref(obj)`` which is much faster.

``PYFUNCTYPE(restype, *argtypes)`` : funcdesc
    TBD

``pythonapi()`` : funcdesc
    XXX Not a function.

``resize(obj, size)`` : funcdesc
    This function resizes the internal memory buffer of obj, which
    must be an instance of a ctypes type. It is not possible to make
    the buffer smaller than the native size of the objects type, as
    given by sizeof(type(obj)), but it is possible to enlarge the
    buffer.

``set_conversion_mode(encoding, errors)`` : funcdesc
    This function sets the rules that ctypes objects use when
    converting between 8-bit strings and unicode strings. encoding
    must be a string specifying an encoding, like ``'utf-8'`` or
    ``'mbcs'``, errors must be a string specifying the error handling
    on encoding/decoding errors. Examples of possible values are
    ``"strict"``, ``"replace"``, or ``"ignore"``.

    set_conversion_mode returns a 2-tuple containing the previous
    conversion rules. On windows, the initial conversion rules are
    ``('mbcs', 'ignore')``, on other systems ``('ascii', 'strict')``.

``sizeof(obj_or_type)`` : funcdesc
    Returns the size in bytes of a ctypes type or instance memory
    buffer. Does the same as the C ``sizeof()`` function.

``string_at(address[, size])`` : funcdesc
    This function returns the string starting at memory address
    address. If size is specified, it is used as size, otherwise the
    string is assumed to be zero-terminated.

``WinError(code=None, descr=None)`` : funcdesc
    Windows only: this function is probably the worst-named thing in
    ctypes. It creates an instance of WindowsError. If ``code`` is not
    specified, ``GetLastError`` is called to determine the error
    code. If ``descr`` is not spcified, ``FormatError`` is called to
    get a textual description of the error.

``WINFUNCTYPE(restype, *argtypes)`` : funcdesc
    TBD

``wstring_at(address)`` : funcdesc
    This function returns the wide character string starting at memory
    address ``address`` as unicode string. If ``size`` is specified,
    it is used as the number of characters of the string, otherwise
    the string is assumed to be zero-terminated.


data types
----------

``_CData`` : classdesc*
    This non-public class is the base class of all ctypes data types.
    Among other things, a ctypes type instance contains a memory block
    that contains C compatible data.

Common methods of ctypes data types, these are all class methods (to
be exact, they are methods of the metaclass):

``from_address(address)`` : methoddesc
    This method returns a ctypes type instance using the memory
    specified by address.

``from_param(obj)`` : methoddesc
    This method adapts obj to a ctypes type. 

``in_dll(name, library)`` : methoddesc
    This method returns a ctypes type instance exported by a shared
    library. name is the name of the symbol that exports the data,
    library is the loaded shared library.

simple data types
-----------------

``_SimpleCData`` : classdesc*
    This non-public class is the base class of all simple ctypes data
    types. It is mentioned here because it contains the common
