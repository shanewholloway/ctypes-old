codegenerator bugs:

- Don't use the no-longer existing cdecl or stdcall decorators.

- Don't generate code for COM interfaces.

- In ctypes/comtypes: Move GUID and _GUID into ctypes.wintypes.

- Import definitions from ctypes.wintypes

- When no '-o outfile' flag is given to h2xml.py, it generates an
  output file named 'None' ;-).

- Import the old docs into cvs.

- Write a README file.
