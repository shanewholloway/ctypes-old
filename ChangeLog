	* source/*.[ch]: Introduced PyCArgObject objects, which contain a
	Python object itself and also the data converted to C. This
	replaces the magic 3-tuples, and should be somewhat faster because
	no two conversions take place.

	This is now used by SimpleType_from_param(), byref(), and
	Pointer_as_parameter(), and is understood by ConvParam().

 	In the long run this should be the only thing (besides primitive
	Python data types with trivial conversions) used by ConvParam().

 	Also ConvParam should probably *return* these things.

	* source/_ctypes.c: Rewrite of SimpleType_from_param complete.
	unittests/test_parameters.py shows that it does the right things
	in most cases.
	
	* (Repository): Moved everything from local CVS to the SF
	repository, and restructured the directories.
