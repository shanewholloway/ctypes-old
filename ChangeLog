	* (Repository): Added a packages directory, and created a ctcom
	package.  See separate changelog.

2003-02-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source/_ctypes.c: The .from_parameter method of POINTER classes now
	accept Array instances containing elements of exactly the same
	type.

	* source/callproc.c: Make sure call_comproc checks for valid
	number of arguments before calling _CallProc.

	* Version 0.4.0 released and uploaded.
	
	* source/_ctypes.c: PointerType_new, ArrayType_new,
	SimpleType_new, and CFunctionType_new did not check for NULL
	result from PyType_Type.tp_new() call.  This call will fail in
	Python 2.3 when 'object' is listed as the first base class with a
	TypeError: MRO conflict among bases.  Spotted by Greg Chapman.

2003-02-05  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* The 'raw' and 'value' properties of c_wstring are back, also
	fixed some severe bugs (it seems c_wstring never worked
	correctly).

	Added unittests.

	* Fixed a problem in c_string: The NUL byte at the buffer end
	could be overwritten.  Added unittests for c_strings.

	Per suggestion from Niki Spahiev, CFieldObjects now have a
	readonly size and offset property.  Added short docs for them.

	* Item deletion on Array or Pointer instances did crash with a
	NULL pointer access.  Added unittest for this, and also for
	Arrays.

2003-01-28  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source\_ctypes.c: Dangerous code checked in.  Pointer instances
	can point to a single data item, or they can point to an array of
	values.  Back in the distant past ;-), I had a SetSize() method,
	which would enable indexes != 0.  Don't know when and why I
	removed it, but I need it again.  Should it have to be enabled
	explicitely?  Would be better, it seems.
 
 	Note that there's no corresponding ass_item implementation with
	indexes != 0.  This means, we can get and change the items the
	pointer points to, if they are mutable, but not replace the items
	by different ones.


2003-01-24  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (several): Fixed the alignment and size of the compound
	datatypes Structure, Union, and hopefully also Array.

2003-01-23  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source/_ctypes.c: Raise a TypeError if a SimpleCData type or a
	CDataType is specified as a CFunction's restype.
	
	* source/_ctypes.c: CFunction now has a from_param class method.
	This means that CFunction subclasses can now be used in the
	argtypes attribute, and so typechecking is done.

	* unittests: Rewrote the tests from doctest to pyunit.

2003-01-21  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source/: Merged in these changes from the C_FAST_CARGS branch:

	ConvParam returns PyCArgObject instances now.  Fixed the
	_as_parameter_ properties of Array, CString, and CFunction so that
	they 'return' PyCArgObject instances instead of magic tuples.

	Added a public 'P' fielddescriptor, which is mostly for internal
	use.

	The 's' rettype value for functions is probably useless, because
	functions return *pointers* to strings (char *), not strings.

	Adapted all the unittests to work, and also changed the samples.

2003-01-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source/*.[ch]: Introduced PyCArgObject objects, which contain a
	Python object itself and also the data converted to C.  This
	replaces the magic 3-tuples, and should be somewhat faster because
	no two conversions take place.

	This is now used by SimpleType_from_param(), byref(), and
	Pointer_as_parameter(), and is understood by ConvParam().

 	In the long run this should be the only thing (besides primitive
	Python data types with trivial conversions) used by ConvParam().

 	Also ConvParam should probably *return* these things.


2003-01-17  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* source/_ctypes.c: Rewrite of SimpleType_from_param complete.
	unittests/test_parameters.py shows that it does the right things
	in most cases.
	
	* (Repository): Moved everything from local CVS to the SF
	repository, and restructured the directories.
