	* comtypes\server\register.py: For localserver, the wrong script
	was registered when the class was not in a toplevel module.

2006-08-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Version number changed to 0.3.0, added 'comtypes.server' package
	to the setup script.

	* Merged in a LOT of changes from the upstream version.
	For details see the svn commit messages.

	The most prominent changes are:

	- The strings returned by ITypeInfo::GetDocumentation() do not
	contain NUL characters any more (some buggy typelibs contain them)

	- comtypes.client.GetEvents returns a 'connection object', which
	will UnAdvise the connection when deleted.  In other words, you
	must keep the return value of the GetEvents call as long as you
	want to reveive events.

	- Pointer to COM interface pointer instances __setitem__ method manages
	the COM refcount correctly.

	- Changes in the COM shutdown code: maybe the win32com way of
	never calling CoUninitialize() is the best compromise ;-), but I
	have not yet given up.

	* Imported comtypes 0.2.1 into the python.org svn repository.

2006-04-25  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Released version 0.2.1 (svn revision 8).

2006-03-07  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Imported comtypes from the ctypes CVS repository into the
	comtypes SVN repository.

2006-03-03  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* (Repository): Move the code generator modules into the
	comtypes.tools package.  Should be refactored later - most
	important is now that it works again.

2006-02-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* Merged in lots of changes from the upstream version.  Started
	localserver support.

2005-10-20  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\__init__.py: Add logging for easier debugging.  Add
	COINIT_... flags.  Use the value of sys.coinit_flags (when
	defined) in the call to CoInitializeEx, this allows to use
	multithreaded appartments.

	Clean up the lifetime management of implemented COM objects.  Make
	COM attribute access case insensitive (has a large impact on the
	performance, unfortunately).

	Move the COMObject definition in a separate module
	comtypes\_comobject.py.

	* comtypes\tools\codegenerator.py: Don't generate dispid() for
	non-dispatch based interfaces.
	
	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Add logging for easier debugging.

	* comtypes\persist.py: Remove dispid() from non-dispatch based
	interfaces. Correct the Read method. Hack around the
	POINTER(c_wchar) <-> c_wchar_p problem.

2005-10-11  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Renamed CreateModule() into
	GetModule().  Removed the 'modulename' parameter from all the
	function calls - the typelib wrapper alias name is now taken from
	the typelib library name.  Suggestions from Bruce Dodson.

2005-09-29  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\GUID.py: Rename the GUID.progid() classmethod into
	GUID.as_progid().

2005-09-02  Thomas Heller  <theller@python.net>

	* comtypes\client\__init__.py: Can now receive events from custom,
	non-dispatch interfaces.
